# Welcome the Security By Design

Security by design is a proven method to develop products that are less vulnerable for cyber security threats.

Cyber security should be the highest priority when developing a new product. 
* Threats continue to rise.
* Customers demand risk free products and are more aware of digital threats.
* You are liable when severe security problems arise in your products.

Security by design is not a product. Nor a simple straight through process. Security by design can be viewed as a core philosophy to do the right things from a cyber security perspective in every action performed when developing and producing a new product. 

Cyber security is a key quality aspect that can not be integrated later within your product. You can not create a better security foundation when your product is finished. Security is a core product property that is almost impossible to add later. 

Security should be seen as a foundation that is developed in parallel with your new product. A good security foundation can not be designed in isolation from product development.
