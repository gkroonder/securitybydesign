# Openness

This publication is real open content.

We believe in [openness](https://www.bm-support.org/open-company-principles/) to simplify cyber security.

We believe open access is mandatory for simplifying and improving cyber security.

Open access is the unlimited sharing and reuse of publications and data. Open access for cyber security means knowledge should be freely accessible. So without borders. Applying user tracking or other privacy barriers for publications is not open access.

Open access improves:
* Sharing cyber solution in an easy way.
* Quality of existing solutions. Improving is often better than to reinvent the wheel.
