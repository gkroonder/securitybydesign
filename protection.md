Security protection measurements lower the risk of cyber security breaches.
:::



Protection measurements can be technical solutions or policies without any technical measurement needed. Mind that for all technical solutions, always strong security management processes are needed.

Besides all measurements to digital protect information on your system, do not forget the importance of physical security measurements.


Physical security protection can be e.g.:
* Physical entry controls;
* Monitoring and surveillance (e.g., CCTV, GPS tracking, sensitivity sensors).
* Protection of data centers and data rooms;
* Environmental protection; (e.g. high fence)
* Protection of information assets during transport and secure disposal.
